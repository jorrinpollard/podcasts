				Alan Macey - (Manual Gearbbox Preservation Society)
			</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p>Alan Macey thinks about cars differently than we do. After graduating from Art Center of Pasadena (arguably the best school for automotive design in the world), he interned at VW, and then worked as a designer at Jeep. He sees cars differently than us. We see a panel gap, and he knows why it's that size. He understands the constraints designers have when they design a new car. He also created the Manual Gearbox Preservation Society ( links below).   We talk about design, Bugatti, VW, challenges of selling a new car, and then we get into a DEEP conversation about AI, the future of car ownership, and argue about how soon it will all arrive.   It's a good listen. </p><p>New Shirts: <a href="https://www">https://www</a>.blipshift/com/tst</p><p>Follow us!</p><p>T: @thesmokingtire @zackklapman @amacey3000</p><p>IG: @thesmokingtire @fakezackklapman </p><p>https://www.facebook.com/TheManualGearboxPreservationSociey/<br />https://thecurbshop.com/collections/all-products</p><p> </p><p>WATCH this show: https://youtu.be/S9ocH3gZ3Yw</p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>After leaving radio to work in the middle of Australia, Manuel Carrillo III found a job around hs favorite thing: cars. He writes for a large number of websites, films and photograhs, but his focus right now is restoring the Porsche 911 he was driven home in after he was born. Yanked from cluttered garage, he dragged it to SEMA in its current state; a car that was honest about where it had been. He talks to us about the car's journey, and a broken Mustang that seems impossible to fix. </p><p>Other topics include the duration of a Safari build, the upcoming Radwood 2 show, cheap 90s cars, and how to make $150,000 into $80,000. </p><p> </p><p>This show is available as a video! https://youtu.be/2ZqSs3E4kdU</p><p> </p><p><strong>Check out Manuel's content here: </strong></p><p><strong>YT</strong>: https://www.youtube.com/user/ManuelCarrillo3</p><p><strong>Internet Brands:</strong> https://www.internetbrandsauto.com/blog/author/manuel-carrillo-iii/</p><p><strong>Instagram</strong>: https://www.instagram.com/mc3films/</p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>Anthony Lahner started his career painting wheels in alleys, but now he runs a company that can restore or perfect the look of any car. We interview him in the second half of the show, after Matt and Zack talk about drifting and bad car movies.</p><p>He brought Matt's R32 GT-R back to factory-fresh and upholstered the interior of his Mustang, but he's done far more than that, from cutting his teeth working at a luxury service center to painting out of a van. He's learned which luxury cars are cheap, what causes some weird Ferrari problems, how to protect you car, and has some funny stories about the early days.</p><p>In addition, Zack took his E46 drifting- finally- and saw some interesting match ups at the track, so we compare the drifting dynamics of an M3, a 240SX, and the other things we've slid. Topics also include a hilariously-bad car movie from the 80s, why gasoline gets hot, and plenty more. </p><p>EXOTICAR: http://www.exoticar-la.com/</p><p> </p><p>This show is available as a video!</p><p>https://youtu.be/4YKEoU1EnRM</p>]]>

We also talk collector car values, investments good and bad, and discuss the never-ending debate of whether to run all cars on the same tires at "Lightning Lap" style events, or to "run what ya brung" </p><p>This show is available as a video!</p><p>https://youtu.be/vQoYaIJiIyw</p><p> </p>]]>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p>This week we bring you an onslaught of automotive industry asshattery, with too many damned people in the room.  We're joined by Mike Spinelli, Travis Okulski, Brendan McAleer and Austin Cabot. Mike gives us his take on on the Porsche GT3 RS as well as an overview of the soundtrack to Dante's Peak, Stevee Nicks encounters and a young boy's take on Burt Monroe.

With a full 60% of the people on the podcast this week owning Fiesta STs we of course cover the virtues of these diminuitive giants. Thad hustled his Fiesta up the Virginia City Hillclimb, I completed the upgrades on my car courtesy of Mountune, Powerflex, MagnaFlow and Pierce Motorsports and "BarkM" tells us why his Boss 302 doesn't get much use. Matt fresh back from Detroit is under embargo however he returns with stories of general lawlessness updates on the Mustang and a brief comparison between the Hellcat and CTS-V. In addition "BarkM" reviews the 2015 911 GT3 (991) and we look back once again at investment opportunities missed from the early 90s.,</p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>This week we're joined by AJ Gordon of <a href="http://www.petersen.org/">The Petersen Automotive Museum</a> and the <a href="http://shoutengine.com/CarStories/">Car Stories</a> podcast.  AJ came by to inform our audience that The Petersen is doing a little fundraising to help restore their 1948 Davis Divan via <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/let-s-build-this-3-wheeled-car-together">IndieGogo</a>.  An admittedly strange car but nonetheless and important part of Los Angeles' history. Matt is fresh back from announcing half mile runway racing and he left half of his vocal chords on the track; while I'm down for the count this week with laryngitis. In addition we cover importing Japenese classics, the 2015 Subary WRX STi, the possibility of a revamped Honda CRZ and a somewhat surprising comparison of the C6 Z06 vs the C7 Z06.</p><p> </p><p> </p>]]>

Bodie has been in the business a long time and shares his experience in running a high-end shop, working with client's, and managing projects while maintaining an artistic influence to expensive fabrication projects. We talk suspension, welding, CNC and all the things you'd expect but we also touch on drunk gaming, SEMA, bro-trucks, Fast and Furious 7 and even a bizarre pizza fetish.</p>]]>

Pur Sang builds what are referred to as "continuation cars" which basically amount to exact recreations of classic cars built entirely by hand. Some might dismiss Pur Sangs Bugattis as kit cars but you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between an original factory Bugatti and a Pur Sang continuation built in exactly the same manner as the original.

This week we discuss the US Nissan Skyline market, Jack tells us about his time in a McLaren racecar and their 650S, we talk Detroit Auto Show, Ford GT, ATS-V, CTS-V, Boss 302 vs GT350, C7 vs C6 ZO6 and why a 996 track car makes very little sense. Also Matt got a moving violation on his bicycle.</p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>This week we're joined by Travis Okulski (<a href="https://twitter.com/tokulski">@tokulski</a>) Editor at <a href="http://jalopnik.com/">Jalopnik</a> along with Jeff Glucker (<a href="https://twitter.com/jglucker">@JGlucker</a>) co-founder of <a href="http://hooniverse.com/">Hooniverse</a>.  Travis is in town for the <strong>Corvette Z06 launch</strong> and Jeff... well he was just killing time after recording a <a href="http://shoutengine.com/Hooniverse/">Hooniverse Podcast</a>. With Travis' impending time in the Z06 we of course discuss that and the potential of its new 8 speed automatic. But we also touch on Top Gear, launching an M4 via a 5" curb, many bad Bob Dylan jokes, an update on Matt's Lexus LS400 and <a href="https://vine.co/xpacNino">Nino's new status as a Vine celebrity</a>.</p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>This week we're joined in studio by fabricator, daredevil and television host Jessi Combs (<a href="https://twitter.com/TheJessiCombs">@TheJessiCombs</a>). You'll probably know Jessi best from Overhaulin', Mythbusters and All Girls Garage but she came in to school us on chasing speed records at Bonneville in turbine powered batshit fueled "cars" that are way faster than anything you've ever driven. In addition we talk a bit about fabrication, her time working with Chip Foose and Chris Jacobs and possibly most impressive of all her win at King of Hammers. All of that plus the usual idiocy you've come to know us for.</p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>This week we round up the 3 finest detailers in North America to hone the finish on.... a Fox Body Notchback with incredibly shitty paint.  We brought nuclear warheads to a knife fight, but sometimes that's just how we do things.  Jason Rose (<a href="http://www.meguiars.com/">Meguiars</a>), Kevin Brown (<a href="http://www.buffdaddy.com/">Buff Daddy.com</a>) and of course our very own Larry Kosilla (<a href="http://www.ammonyc.com/">AMMO NYC</a>) dive deep into the world of detailing.  This episode represents a commitment to cleaning and presentation that would make your mother proud.  Although we still discourage sharing these shows with your mom. All that plus the detail masters answer listener questions.</p><p> </p><p> </p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>This week we welcome back our friend Duncan Ende (<a href="https://twitter.com/DuncanEnde">@DuncanEnde</a>) who has recently taken the helm of a Prototype Challenge car in the <a href="http://www.imsa.com/">IMSA TUDOR Championship</a> series driving for RSR Racing.  This week we discuss the virtual wasteland that is Indianapolis, GTD Cars, the gorgeous new C7R, what it's like to drive an open cockpit racecar in the wet, and Duncan's Le Mans ambitions.  Additionally we touch on blinding shift lights, Bob Ross, the drunken outfield of Sebring, Veyrons, Koenigsegg's crazy cam-less cylinder heads, Rolex's and Matt outlines the most efficient way to pick up a stripper. </p>]]>
